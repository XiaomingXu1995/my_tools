It is used for computation the distance between the distance outputs of RabbitKSSD and bindash.

The parsing of the large distance files contains a simple producer-consumer openmp implementation, see more details in the source file [cmp_dist_RabbitKSSD_binDash.cpp](../src/cmp_dist_RabbitKSSD_binDash.cpp)
